        <p>This was by far one of the most interesting assignments I worked on in this course. It gave me the opportunity to explore many technologies and it quickly became an excuse to start exploring subjects that I had long been wanting to look into.
        </p>
        <p>getRecipe();, at its current stage, generates a random recipe each time the user clicks on the gerente recipe button. I plan on expanding it into a project where the user input consists of items they have in the kitchen and the application matches this input to a recipe. 
        </p>          
        <p>The structure of the application consists of a js directory that contains the main.js file. All the JavaScript of the project live in this file. The res directory that includes the png files for the application’s UI. The web interface has two HTML pages, an “about” page that you are reading right now and a “search” page where all the magic happens. This page has a card element that is set to be hidden and when the data is ready to be shown on the page, it’s display property is set to block. This is where the recipe gets displayed.
        </p>
        <h2 class="titleText" id="title-info"><b>main.js</b></h2> 
        <p>A big bonus of this project was getting to finally take a look at JavaScript. Initially I was intrigued by the possibilities that it provides. I did find interesting libraries that you can do amazing things with and it seems like a creative playground. But then after a while, I got really frustrated with the asynchronous nature of it. I think it requires a much deeper understanding of its basic core concepts or maybe more experience.
